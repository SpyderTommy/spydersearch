# SPYDERSEARCH

A Google-type clone that remakes the entirety of Google's systems. Heavily created by Tommy & his father, SpyderSearch was made specifically to showcase the search engine with many more easter eggs.

Featuring: Easter Eggs, Eaglercraft Cheat Engines, and Blooket & Kahoot hacks. (You gotta find em :D)
